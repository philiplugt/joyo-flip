### Details

For many foreigners the first step to learning kanji is learning the meaning of the characters, after which phonetics and vocabulary are learnt. Joyo flip is a tool that focusses on the former. 

Joyo flip helps associate the kanji character to a meaning in English. It helps users reinforce this knowledge via a memory-like game. The tool also gives users an overview of all 2136 joyo kanjis. This allows users to identify which kanjis they already know versus the kanjis they need to practice.
